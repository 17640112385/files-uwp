# Quick guide for the process we use on GitHub

There are two main branches in the Files UWP reposistory,
- Master
- Develop

### Master
`Master` is the stable branch, this has the code for the latest release in the Microsoft Store. Only pull requests from the `develop` branch will be merged in here.

### Develop
`Develop` is the development branch which includes all the latest changes from Files UWP, beta builds will be released from this branch. Once `develop` is found to be stable then it will be merged in to `master`.

### Other branches
There are other branches as well in the Files UWP repository, these are usually for new features or changes that are still a work in progress and not yet ready to be merged in to `develop`. These branches are temporary and will be removed once the changes are merged in to `develop`.


## Contributing to Files UWP

To get started, create a fork of the repository on GitHub. You will need to do that to make any changes since the Files UWP repo is restricted to a few contributors of the app. If you decide to make a change you should always do it on the `develop` branch. Once your change is completed you can open a pull request which we will review and if we like it we will merge it in ðŸ˜€
